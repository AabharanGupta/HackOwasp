            <p>
                RickGo intends to make commuting around campus more feasible and flexible for students. We aim to connect students to rickshaw drivers and make their campus life easier. Students can easily contact rickshaw drivers to their required boarding point. It mitigates the unnecessary hassle students have to face in their day-to-day travel, especially for students residing in hostels isolated from the main areas of the campus.
